# Pupdate: Pet Manager

Pupdate is a small php web application to manage pets. It was originally created to manage our new puppy in a busy household. 

Pupdate allows for multiple pets and has the ability to have a shortcut added on iOS and Android for quick and easy "pupdating"

## Installation

Pupdate should work on any modern web server running php and mysql/mariadb. Place the files in the web directory of your choice, load the provided db schema and place database settings in /inc/config.php

## Usage

Using the interface, add your first pet. Pupdate away.

## Contributing

This is just a quick update so that I finally get this out into the world.
Pull requests are welcome. I see many areas that can be added and improved. Once the core functionality proved solid things like eventually adding graphs etc were put on the back-burner (read: I became lazy)
